<h1>RGB COLOR Generator and Random Phone Number Generator</h1>
This project includes two simple web applications: a random phone number generator for various telecommunication operators in Rwanda and an RGB color generator that displays hexadecimal and RGB values of generated colors.

<h2>Random Phone Number Generator</h2>
This web application generates random phone numbers for MTN, Tigo, Airtel, and other networks in Rwanda. The user can specify the number of phone numbers they want to generate, and the application generates random phone numbers based on the user's input.
<h3>Features</h3>
- Generate random phone numbers for various telecommunication operators in Rwanda.
- Specify the number of phone numbers to generate.
- Copy phone numbers to the clipboard for easy sharing or use.
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
<h2>RGB COLOR Generator</h2>
This web application generates random colors and displays their hexadecimal and RGB values.
<h3>Features</h3>
- Generates a random color on page load.
- Generates a new color on button click.
- Displays the hexadecimal and RGB values of the generated color.
- Allows users to copy the color's hexadecimal value to the clipboard.
<h3>Usage</h3>
To generate a new color, click the "New Color" button. To copy the hexadecimal value of the generated color, click the "Copy Hex" button. The RGB value of the generated color is displayed below the hexadecimal value.
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
<h3>Functions Used in JavaScript</h3>
- Math.floor()
- forEach loop
- switch case
- API geolocation by apapi.co
<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
- Allow users to specify the telecommunication operator they want to generate phone numbers for.
- Add more customization options for the generated phone numbers (e.g., country code, phone number length, etc.).
- Improve the design and user experience of the application.
<h3>Credits</h3>
The idea and code for this application were developed by <b>IRANZI THIERRY</b>. The phone number generation algorithm used in this application was inspired by similar algorithms found on the internet. This project was inspired by this tutorial by Traversy Media. Special thanks to @nigorjeanluc for their support.
<h3>Project Timeline</h3>
This project was completed from May 5th to May 7th.
<h3>School Course Reference</h3>
This project incorporates knowledge from my studies at CGFK, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the use of various functions such as Math.floor(), forEach loop, switch case, and API geolocation by apapi.co.
